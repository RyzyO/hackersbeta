The 10th hole is a dog-leg right-power 4.
Aim for the pine trees on the left side with your T-shirt, avoiding the right-hand fairway bunkers.
This will leave you with a nice approach shot to a very long narrow green with one bunker on the left side.
Avoid missing right, which leaves a very difficult chip shot.
