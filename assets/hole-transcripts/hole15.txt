The short-powerful 15th hole is rated the easiest hole on the golf course.
The long hitters will drive the green if they can fly the two well-position bunkers.
The water has it to the right creates a good visual, but isn't really in play as the
fairway dog legs from left to right, so there's plenty of room to the left.
Massive green and a good birdie opportunity.
