The 16th is a long dog leg left, powerful hole.
No real problems other than keeping your drive to the right of the fairway bunker,
for a good approach shot into a big flat green with two bunkers to the left
and one to the right. There are two big grassy mounds to avoid on the right side of the fairway.
