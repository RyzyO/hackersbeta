The Power 5-7 is the signature hole at Warigilinx.
The T-Shot from the plate presents a spectacular visual on this dog left hole with out of bounds all the way down the left side.
Aim for the bunkers in the distance, where a nice straight drive over the water will set you up well for your second shot.
Always keep left with your approach shot into a long narrow green.
This is a three-shot Power 5, which should be played conservatively.
The green is too long and narrow to attempt going forward.
Play smart, stay left of the bunkers with your approach shot, which will give you a great angle to the green.
