The opening hole at Warrigee Lynx is a relatively short power 5 with little trouble and a good opportunity to start with the birdie.
A straight drive to the right of the fairway bunkers will set up an approachable second shot.
Like most holes at Warrigee Lynx, the best place to miss is short of the green for an easy chip to a long flat narrow-putting surface.
Avoid missing pin-high due to rough lies and little green to work with.
