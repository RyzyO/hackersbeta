The 18th is a good power-five finishing hole.
Not much trouble other than a few fairway bunkers on the left, but otherwise fine.
Avoid the grassy mound short left of the green,
and bunkers either side, a long narrow green,
best to land just short from an easy chip
and a great opportunity to finish off your round well.
